= jBake Transparent CLI Docker


== Build

    docker build -t mh/jbake .

== Run

Since this is a transparent call of docker image from commandline, wehre a new files are generated, it is a good idea to root in docker as a host user, not as a root.


  docker run -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -v `pwd`:/work mh/antlr  JSON.g4

You can define alias in *working directory* (because of pwd), but recommended praxis is to add it into your shel script as function

    alias jbake="docker run -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -p 8820:8820 -v `pwd`:/work mh/jbake"
