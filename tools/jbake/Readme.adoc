= jBake Transparent CLI Docker


== Build

    docker build -t mh/jbake .

== Run

Since this is a transparent call of docker image from commandline, wehre a new files are generated, it is a good idea to root in docker as a host user, not as a root.


  docker run -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -v `pwd`:/work mh/jbake  JSON.g4




.shell
[source, bash]
