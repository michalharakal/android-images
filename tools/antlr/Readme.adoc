= ANTLR Docker 

== Update source code

Make sure, that nested submodule with antlr source code has been downloaded. (Its hack until DOcker became a part of antlr, see https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/2810) 

    git submodule update --init --recursive

== Build

    docker build -t mh/antlr .

== Run

Since this is a transparent call of docker image from commandline, wehre a new files are generated, it is a good idea to root in docker as a host user, not as a root.


  docker run -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -v `pwd`:/work mh/antlr  JSON.g4
